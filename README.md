I've been working with software development for 10 years, graduated in Information Systems and currently I'm CTO and partner at Sotero Tech, where I work as leader of development teams and software architect.

I am passionate about code, quality and software architecture with experience in different market segments.
Solving the world's problems and challenges through technology is one of my missions.
